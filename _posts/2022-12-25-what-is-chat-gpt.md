One day I woke up and saw my [twitter](https://twitter.com/myselfshubhendu) timeline was filled with all funny conversation with [**Chat-gpt**]().Hence being a curious troubleshooter, I just google and did some handson chat-gpt open AI tool. So, here are my few insights what I learnt from it.

let's understand in layman terms. First thing first is what is **GPT**? 

**GPT** stands for the Generative Pre-trained Transformer.it uses [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) i.e Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback  which means a method that uses human demonstrations to guide the model towards desired behaviours.

It was created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com), a San Francisco-based AI and research company, launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. OpenAI also created Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system, and DALLEâ€¢2, a popular AI image and art generator.ChatGPT is specifically designed to mimic real conversations, and the bot is capable of explaining, remembering what was said earlier in the conversation, elaborating on ideas when asked, and even apologizing when it gets things wrong. Chat-GPT is using the same [instruct method](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/)but with slight differences in the data collection setup.

ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series here. ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.

If we can break down iteration into 3 steps then its majorly will be like :- 

1. Collect demonstration data and train a supervised policy 

2. Collect comparison data and train a reward model

3. Optimise a policy against the reward model using the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm.

**How to use chat-gpt**?

Now start exploring the chat Gpt and finished your college assignments with it ASAP!!

Before we wind up, here is the comes the most generaic question "How much trustworthy this chat-GPT is?"

Since trust issue lies everywhere, but AI is more trustworthy than your friends. As per offficial release 
ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.


Keep Learnig, Keep Troubleshooting!
