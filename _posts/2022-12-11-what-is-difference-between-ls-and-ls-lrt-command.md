Hey folks, as a coder or techie we often do use **terminal** to interact with our files. And we all are familiar with **ls** command.Basically we use ls command for listing the contents of a directory.

ls command :

But what about if there are thousands of files inside a folder and we have to pick or sort a particular file within time frame? In such case using ls command and going line by line doesn't makes sense?

So here we do have **lrt** option which is bascially combo three different options which provide us extra flexibility.

**l** : It displays the listing of the content with ownerships, permissions and size of a file.

**r** : It reverse the order of command output.


**t** : It sortlists files on the time basis.

The combination of these commands display the files in reverse chronological order from same file directory.
