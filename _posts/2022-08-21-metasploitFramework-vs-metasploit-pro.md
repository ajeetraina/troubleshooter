In the tug of war game of tools, we always confused with community edition and Pro. Both have their own separate use cases, we can't compare. But let's talk about what's the difference between them in the case of <strong> "Metasploit" </strong>

**History of Metasploit**

HD Moore began working on Metasploit in the early oughts, and released 1.0, written in Perl, in 2003. The project has grown dramatically since then, from the original 11 exploits the project came with to more than 1,500 now, plus around 500 payloads, with a switch to Ruby under the hood along the way.

Security outfit Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009. (Moore left the project in 2016.) Metasploit has since become the de facto framework for exploit development, despite competition from Canvas and Core Impact. Today it is common for zero day reports to include a Metasploit module as proof of concept.

Q. What do you mean by Metasploit ?

A. The Metasploit Project is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute the exploit code. This exploit code can be custom-made by the user or taken from a database containing the latest already discovered and modularized exploits.

It is a collection of tools that provides a complete env for penetration testing and exploit development.
